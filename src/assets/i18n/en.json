It is necessary to have the right to handle independence, interdependence, and peer group with dependency responsibility.",
        "4": "It is important to note that adolescence requires social and emotional support. It is very helpful to make such support in order to improve behavior, to cope with the risks of life, to manage peer pressure and to acquire the skills necessary to deal with the problems of sex. On such basis, confusion and misconceptions can be made about these changes and negative consequences can be made on their academic and other non-academic activities.",
        "5": "The C.A.B.E committee report on Universalization of Secondary Education (2004), states that -",
        "6": "Future education, then, would be a holistic responsive education facilitating manifestation of perfection already in man and woman. It also implies the cognitive, emotive and physical attributes of future citizens to be founded on a sound value paradigm. This will require re-conceptualising secondary education and a building a fresh new concept. Emphasis in secondary education has to be shifted from ‘mugging up’ a few content items for writing examination to school as holistic living experience. This implies a paradigm shift in the conceptualisation of secondary education itself.",
        "7": "Secondary education spreads over the ages of 15 and 16, and then to 17 and 18 in the senior secondary grades. These are the years of adolescence, and late adolescence. These are the years of transition; indeed, most crucial years of life.",
        "8": "There are steady and fast changes in the body structure transforming to adult form and image of life. At this age, the bodily changes take final shape and stabilise. Established theories of intelligence also indicate that growth of intelligence stabilise at this age, although the new generation brain research indicates that because of continuous reorganisation of brain neurons, intelligence may continue to grow beyond this age. From the angle of multiple intelligence, this age is the most significant since the potentialities unfold faster and stabilise.",
        "9": "The childhood voice cracks and takes the final shape (important for budding musicians); majority of the players show their final promise at this stage, and so on. This is also the stage of emotional transformation and maturity that swings between joy and trauma. Secondary education essentially has to be the education of the adolescence.",
        "10": "Experiences in schooling have to be designed to be responsive to the needs of transition and stabilisation. Since large number of students are likely to transit from education to the world of work, it is also the stage of transition to work. Secondary education must foster skills of transition.",
        "11": "Although both boys and girls experience transit, it is a special stage for girls and they need special attention. Because of the many prejudices, restrictions and social codes of conduct, girls' transition status is more difficult. Child marriage is still prevalent in many parts of the country and it is an obstacle to girls education. That is why boys and girls need to develop a conducive course for both."
